WikiBuddy
=========

### About:

This simple Ruby script (`main.rb`) does two things. It makes sure the links under the `### Related to:` heading
are reciprocal, and it automatically creates a tree of you pages for you `_Sidebar`. WikiBuddy was designed to work
with the Wiki on GitHub. So far it only supports markdown pages.
